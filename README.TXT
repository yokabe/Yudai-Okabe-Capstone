PROJECT TITLE: Image Finder
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This Code takes in a search item from the user and displays an image of that search item
VERSION or DATE: 5/9/2016
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: For now, use the word "cat" as a search item.
AUTHORS: Yudai Okabe

OVERVIEW: At first, this capstone was going to take a webpage and modify every single image to be something else. 
When I learned I couldn’t do that I decided to create a resource finder and from there, it went to coding a program 
that takes in a user search item and displays an image of the search item. The image that is displayed is taken from 
a wikipedia page, and that image is downloaded from the web through the decoding of the webpage html and the locating 
of an image URL in the html.

EXPLANATION: Capstone utilizes the implementation of multiple classes, private and public variables, various public 
methods that are implemented in one class and is used in another, the displaying of a frame and a picture in a frame; 
for loops, if statements, and concatenation to find an image URL in a webpage html and set the url to a string variable; 
the methods and classes that are associated with graphics to display the image, hierarchy of classes with JFrame 
and JComponent, etc.

Additional research was required to find out how to download an image and assign it to an Image type variable 
when given an URL of an image. I also had to do further research on how the URL class and the Image class works, 
so that I can take information from URL’s html, find the image, and download the image with that found URL.


INSTRUCTIONS: Type in a search item of one or two words when asked to by the code in lower case.
